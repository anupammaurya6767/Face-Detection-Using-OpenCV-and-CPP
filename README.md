Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces in digital images. This technique is a specific use case of object detection technology that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings or cars) in digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a lot of importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing.

## Objective
This is the repository linked to the tutorial with the same name. The idea is to introduce people to the concept of object detection in C++ using the OpenCV library and how it can be utilized to perform tasks like Facial detection.

 ## For Demo:
To run just type below command in Face Detection any root folder (either in LIve web cam or Input image folder):\
```
$: g++ main.cpp -o app `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`

```
```
 $: ./app
```
